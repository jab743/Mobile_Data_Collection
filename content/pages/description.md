### Description
It has become relatively easy to track someones physical activity. Pedometers, and heart rate monitors for example have been around for ages doing just this. More recently, products such as the Fitbit and Jawbone have provided amounts of data not previously available. However, outside of activity tracking, there is very little data on human movement itself on large scales.
 
The goal of project, is to develop a mesh network of sensors that an individual would wear on their feet, and have it collect data on that person's gait. Gait, is the pattern of movement of an individual's limbs. This data would then be analyzed by the system, and effectively monitor how a person walks. The system would present the data in a manner which is human readable. Ideally, a health professional would use this and be able to determine if an individual needs to increase the size of their stride, or even go as far as finding issues with an individual's muscles and bones in their lower extremities, before a problem emerges.
