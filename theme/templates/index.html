<h3>The Project</h3>

<p>It has become relatively easy to track someones physical activity. Pedometers, and heart rate
    monitors for example have been around for ages doing just this. More recently, products such as
    the Fitbit and Jawbone have provided amounts of data not previously available. However, outside
    of activity tracking, there is very little data on human movement itself on large scales.</p>
<p>The goal of project, is to develop a mesh network of sensors that an individual would wear on
    their feet, and have it collect data on that person's gait. Gait, is the pattern of movement of
    an individual's limbs. This data would then be analyzed by the system, and effectively monitor
    how a person walks. The system would present the data in a manner which is human readable.
    Ideally, a health professional would use this and be able to determine if an individual needs to
    increase the size of their stride, or even go as far as finding issues with an individual's
    muscles and bones in their lower extremities, before a problem emerges. </p>
